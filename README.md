This repository is meant to help me study machine learning. Specifically, the
packages:

- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [scipy](https://scipy.org/)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

To activate the virtual environment, run the command:
```sh
make
```
It will activate and install any missing dependencies, if they havenâ€™t been
installed yet. To deactivate, use the `exit` command or send an `EOF` character
to your shell (usually `^D`).
